# Should I go for a run today?

AI supported decision making answering the question whether you should go for a run today.

## Training data examples

| Weather  | Temperature in degrees °C | Run or not |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Snowing  | -10°C  | Yes  |
| Raining  | 5°C  | Yes  |
| Cloudy  | 15°C  | Yes  |
| Sunny  | 40°C  | Yes  |
| Blizzard  | -50°C  | Yes  |

All that's missing is a 5B parameter transformer model for answering the question based on data like this. With a fancy animation, of course.
